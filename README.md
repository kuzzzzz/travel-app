# Udacity Front End Nanodegree Capstone Project

## A Travel Booking App
This project is an app that takes a desired location from a user and displays the weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. It also displays some facts about the trip destination like the currency and flag.

The project makes use of tecnologies such as HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, API, Webpack, Babel, and Jest



Node and express are the webserver and routing, and webpack is the build tool of choice. Using webpack, I set up the app to have dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.

## Project Requirements
- Webpack config should contain at least 3 scripts, express server, build and test. Additionally, dev server may be included.
- There should be at least one test for the express server and application javascript.
- The project must have service workers installed.
- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
- Styling is set up in a logical way. All interactive elements have hover states.
- HTML structure should be indented properly with classes and IDâ€™s that make sense.
- There should be URLS and API Keys for at least 3 APIs, including Geonames, Weatherbit, and Pixabay. You can feel free to use more than 3 APIs.
- There should be a primary object with placeholder member value pairs.
- There should be a primary function that is exported to index.js.

## Project Suggestions That Were Implemented
- Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
- Integrate the REST Countries API to pull in data for the country being visited.
- Incorporate icons into forecast.
